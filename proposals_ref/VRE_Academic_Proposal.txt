Proposal for Enhancing the Virtual Research Environment (VRE) Infrastructure

1. Introduction
The rapid advancement of computational research necessitates robust Virtual Research Environments (VREs) to facilitate seamless data management, processing, and provenance tracking. 
This proposal aims to integrate key components—DBRepo (structured repository), Invenio (unstructured repository), and JupyterHub—into a unified system that ensures traceability, 
fairness, and reproducibility in research workflows. The proposed integration follows the W3C PROV standard [1] for provenance data and FAIR principles [2] to enhance data usability.

2. Project Background
Current VRE implementations often suffer from fragmentation, leading to inefficiencies in research workflows. DBRepo stores structured datasets, while Invenio archives unstructured 
metadata and logs, but these repositories operate independently. JupyterHub enables scalable computational tasks but lacks built-in provenance tracking. Addressing these gaps requires 
a cohesive integration strategy that automates metadata generation and enforces data lineage transparency.

3. Objectives
- **Develop API-driven integration** between DBRepo, Invenio, and JupyterHub to facilitate smooth data exchange.
- **Implement a provenance tracking framework** using W3C PROV-O ontology [3] to standardize metadata representation.
- **Ensure compliance with FAIR principles** to improve data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.
- **Automate structured metadata generation** in JSON-LD format for enhanced machine readability and reproducibility.

4. Methodology
- **System Integration**: Utilize RESTful APIs and message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) to synchronize data across DBRepo, Invenio, and JupyterHub.
- **Metadata Framework**: Implement the W3C PROV-O model in RDF and JSON-LD for structured provenance representation.
- **Security and Access Control**: Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using OAuth 2.0 and Keycloak for secure authentication.
- **Validation and Performance Benchmarking**: Conduct stress tests using Apache JMeter and evaluate metadata retrieval performance via SPARQL queries.

5. Expected Outcomes
- A fully integrated VRE with automated provenance tracking and metadata management.
- Improved data traceability, aligning with the Open Science movement and FAIR principles.
- A scalable and extensible architecture enabling seamless adoption across research domains.
- Enhanced security through access control policies and standardized authentication mechanisms.

6. Conclusion
This project aims to advance the state of VRE infrastructure by implementing a standards-compliant, integrated system that enhances research reproducibility and accountability. 
By leveraging W3C PROV-O, FAIR principles, and modern API-driven architectures, this approach will significantly improve transparency and efficiency in data-driven research.
